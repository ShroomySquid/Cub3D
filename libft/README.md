# libft
A library of basic functions in C. This is the first project in the 42 school curriculum. The cursus is restrictive 
in the amount of function we are allow to use during our formation, therefore it is usefull to reproduce 
several basic functions to make later projects easier to write and read. It include functions like ft_putstr_fd, 
a function to put a string on the given file descriptor or ft_lstnew, a function that creates a new chained list.
